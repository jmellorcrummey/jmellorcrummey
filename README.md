John Mellor-Crummey is a Professor of Computer Science at Rice
University in Houston, TX. His research focuses on software technology
for high-performance parallel computing. His current research is
focused on research and development of tools for measurement and
analysis of the performance of applications on scalable parallel
platforms, including GPU-accelerated exascale systems.  The HPCToolkit
Performance Tools project is the primary product of that research.
His past work has included compilers and runtime systems for parallel
computing, scalable synchronization algorithms for shared-memory
multiprocessors, execution replay of parallel programs, data race
detection, and techniques for network performance analysis and
optimization.  Mellor-Crummey co-led development of the OMPT tools
interface for OpenMP 5.  He is a co-recipient of the 2006 Dijkstra
Prize in Distributed Computing and a Fellow of the ACM.
